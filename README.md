# Student-Registration-Aplication
This project is meant to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) information from an existing database using C# and .NET. 
The Database was created using MySQL and XAMPP through PHPMyAdmin.

In this application, the user will go through a login screen where it is supposed to verify its credentials with a valid username and a password that were previously 
created in the Database, under employees Table. 
After that, the user will be able to access the second screen, where it will be able to perform all the CRUD functionalities with the student information.
